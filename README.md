## How I Prepare

- **Daily Goals:** Solve 2-3 problems minimum. Quality > Quantity.
- **Review:** Revisit tough problems and optimize solutions.
- **Mock Tests:** Simulate timed coding rounds.
- **Discussion:** Engage with peers, share insights, and learn new tricks.
- **Consistency:** No shortcuts. Just daily grind.
